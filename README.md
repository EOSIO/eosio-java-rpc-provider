## Prerequisites

<<<<<<< HEAD
* Eclipse 4.5+
* Gradle 4.10.1+
* Gradle Plugin 3.3.0+
* Java SE 8+

This project is compatible with server-side Java, as well as Android 6+. Therefore, any project depending on Java RPC Provider with [EOSIO SDK for Java](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java) **must be a server-side Java or Android 6+ project**. Other RPC providers, however, can be created to support earlier Android versions or other platforms. If your project requires earlier Android version or alternate platform support, or if you'd like to create a RPC provider and have questions, please reach out to us by [logging an issue](/../../issues/new).

## Installation

Java RPC Provider is intended to be used in conjunction with [EOSIO SDK for Java](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java) as a provider plugin.

To use Java RPC Provider with EOSIO SDK for Java in your app, add the following modules to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
implementation 'one.block:eosiojava:0.1.2'
implementation 'one.block:eosiojavarpcprovider:0.1.1'
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
You must also add the following to the `android` section of your application's `build.gradle`:

```groovy
// Needed to get bitcoin-j to produce a valid apk for android.
packagingOptions {
    exclude 'lib/x86_64/darwin/libscrypt.dylib'
    exclude 'lib/x86_64/freebsd/libscrypt.so'
    exclude 'lib/x86_64/linux/libscrypt.so'
}
```
>>>>>>> 0ba26dfdbe619ea99d2a6d2b2839a79e7d04d49d
The `build.gradle` files for the project currently include configurations for publishing the project to Artifactory.  These should be removed if you are not planning to use Artifactory or you will encounter build errors.  To do so, make the changes marked by comments throughout the files.

Then refresh your gradle project.

Now Java RPC Provider is ready for use within EOSIO SDK for Java according to the [EOSIO SDK for Java - Basic Usage instructions](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java/tree/master#basic-usage).

## Direct Usage

If you wish to use Java RPC Provider directly, its public methods can be called like this:

```java
// Synchronous call
EosioJavaRpcProviderImpl rpcProvider = new EosioJavaRpcProviderImpl(
    "https://mytestblockchain.net/"
);
GetRawAbiRequest request = new GetRawAbiRequest("eosio.token");
GetRawAbiResponse response = rpcProvider.getRawAbi(request);
String abi = response.getAbi();
String abiHash = response.getAbiHash();
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

// Asynchronous call
final EosioJavaRpcProviderImpl rpcProvider = new EosioJavaRpcProviderImpl(
    "https://mytestblockchain.net/"
);
GetBlockRequest[] request = { new GetBlockRequest("25260032") };

AsyncTask<GetBlockRequest, Void, GetBlockResponse> asyncTask = new AsyncTask<GetBlockRequest, Void, GetBlockResponse>() {
    GetBlockRpcError getBlockError = null;
    @Override
    protected GetBlockResponse doInBackground(GetBlockRequest... getBlockRequests) {
        // Here we are on a background thread.
        GetBlockResponse response = null;
        try {
            response = rpcProvider.getBlock(getBlockRequests[0]);
        } catch (GetBlockRpcError err) {
            getBlockError = err;
        }
        return response;
    }

    protected void onPostExecute(GetBlockResponse response) {
        // Here we are back on the main thread and could update the UI.
        String blockId = response.getId();
        String blockRefPrefix = response.getRefBlockPrefix();
        // ...

    }
}.execute(request);
>>>>>>> 0ba26dfdbe619ea99d2a6d2b2839a79e7d04d49d
```

Please note that only the following five RPC endpoints have proper response marshalling:

```java
 Call<GetInfoResponse> getInfo();
 Call<GetBlockResponse> getBlock(@Body GetBlockRequest getBlockRequest);
 Call<GetRawAbiResponse> getRawAbi(@Body GetRawAbiRequest getRawAbiRequest);
 Call<GetRequiredKeysResponse> getRequiredKeys(@Body GetRequiredKeysRequest getRequiredKeysRequest);
 Call<PushTransactionResponse> pushTransaction(@Body PushTransactionRequest pushTransactionRequest);
```

The remaining endpoints accept a `RequestBody` as the request object and return a raw JSON string as the response. We aim to continue improving response marshalling for all endpoints, and we invite you to [help us improve](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java-android-rpc-provider/issues/22) responses too. Check [EosioJavaRpcProviderImpl](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java-android-rpc-provider/blob/master/eosiojavarpcprovider/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojavarpcprovider/implementations/EosioJavaRpcProviderImpl.java) for more details.

Here is an example demonstrating how to call RPC endpoints and handle the raw JSON string responses returned:

```java
EosioJavaRpcProviderImpl rpcProvider = new EosioJavaRpcProviderImpl("https://mytestblockchain.net/");

String getCurrentBalanceRequestJSON = "{\n" +
            "\t\"code\" : \"eosio.token\"\n" +
            "\t\"account\" : \"test_account\"\n" +
            "}";
RequestBody requestBody = RequestBody.create(okhttp3.MediaType.parse("application/json; charset=utf-8"), getCurrentBalanceRequestJSON);
String response = rpcProvider.getCurrencyBalance(requestBody);
JSONArray jsonArray = new JSONArray(response);
String balance = jsonArray.getString(0);
```
